## Introduction

Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) constitutes a
pivotal element in autonomous driving perception systems,
tasked with inferring the 3D semantic occupancy of a scene
from sensory data. To improve accuracy, prior research has
implemented various computationally demanding and memory-
intensive 3D operations, imposing significant computational
requirements on the platform during training and testing. This
paper proposes L2COcc, a lightweight camera-centric SSC
framework that also accommodates LiDAR inputs. With our
proposed efficient voxel transformer (EVT) and cross-modal
knowledge modules, including feature similarity distillation
(FSD), TPV distillation (TPVD) and prediction alignment dis-
tillation (PAD), our method substantially reduce computational
burden while maintaining high accuracy. The experimental
evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses
the current state-of-the-art vision-based SSC methods regarding
accuracy on both the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-
360 benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, our method is more
lightweight, exhibiting a reduction in both memory consump-
tion and inference time by over 23% compared to the current
state-of-the-arts method.
